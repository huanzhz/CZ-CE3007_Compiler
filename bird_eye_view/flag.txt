Source code to machine code
compiler is faster than interpreter (why?, scan everything, scan parts of it)

understand that quiet guy that write much better and faster code.
leal -> LEA (load effective address) do calculation of the address without writing to memory.

leal (,%rdi,8), %eax	=>	uint32_t x = n * 8;
(Register %rdi has the value of n)
-> %rdi * 8 store at %eax
leal (%rax,%rax,2), %eax
Magic number	2^38/71+1 = $3871519817
